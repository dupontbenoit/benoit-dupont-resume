During my 13 years career at CHU Tivoli, I had the chance to expand my knowledge and discover multiple facets of the ICT world in a team of 25  great people. From software development to managing servers, give support to the 2000+ end-users, and by managing HL7 medical data workflows between multiple systems and suppliers. Thanks to the InterSystems HealthShare platform.
    
I architected, developed, and put in production a lot of medical, administrative web applications and useful tools for the hospital.

    {
As a startup, I assist Line Up Team in a variety of domains regarding the ITC world.

I have developed and put in production some tools to manage their client's social media statistics by scraping the data from Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. The software is running on a Debian VPS using the Python / Django / Gunicorn / NGINX stack.

I also help the team in managing the servers hosting their client's websites, emails, and DNS. For easier management the server uses cPanel. WordPress is managed using the "wp cli" command-line interface.

The management of the shelter was managed by multiple Excel sheets in one file.
I suggested developing software to make their day-to-day operations easier and more user-friendly.

Based on my experience as a medical software developer at CHU Tivoli, they now have a simplified administrative and medical record to manage the shelter. 

The app is running on a Debian VPS and is built on a Python / Django / NGINX stack.

I also help the shelter team with other ITC tasks like managing their WordPress server and updates.

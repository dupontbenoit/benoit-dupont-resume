Web developer since the availability of the Internet in Belgium (20 years ago, when Microsoft FrontPage and Adobe Dreamweaver were a thing). I quickly moved to PHP dynamic programming language to build CMS-like websites (no-no WordPress didn't exist at that time).

I have a degree in computer sciences. I like to constantly grow my knowledge and experience \Rightarrow  I'm not afraid to learn something new. 

I've architected, developed (from end-to-end), put in production, maintained, and provided end-user support for multiple projects in numerous technologies like Java / Python / HTML / CSS / JavaScript / SQL. Take a look at the \emph{Projects} section for some examples of projects I've contributed to.

Working in a medical environment for 13 years lead me to manipulate, integrate and exchange health information based on HL7 standards multiple times.

I'm agile as I can work on multiple constantly evolving and changing projects at the same time.

Love to code and design great quality user-friendly software.
To me, ICT is a way to make people's lives easier.
